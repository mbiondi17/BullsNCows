# Bulls 'N' Cows Game

This game is an implementation of the second chapter from the Unreal Engine C++ Developer course on Udemy, by GameDev.tv (found here: https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealcourse/)

The game includes some of my own work and additions, though not too many, as I was more using it to learn the ropes of Unreal, not for programming or design practice.
